# Clean Architecture for Frontend Applications

## Overview
Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), is a layered approach to software architecture that aims to separate concerns, making applications maintainable, testable, and scalable. It emphasizes dependency rule enforcement, ensuring that inner layers are independent of outer layers.

## Principles
- **Separation of Concerns** - Business logic is decoupled from UI and frameworks.
- **Dependency Inversion** - High-level policies should not depend on low-level details.
- **Testability** - Core business logic remains isolated and easy to test.
- **Scalability** - The architecture allows easy expansion and refactoring.
- **Maintainability** - Code remains readable and adaptable over time.

## Layers Explanation

1. Domain Layer (domain/)

- Core business logic and rules.
- Independent of frameworks and UI.
- Contains entities, use cases, and repository interfaces.

2. Data Layer (data/)

- Implements repositories, API calls, and database interactions.
- Responsible for fetching and transforming data.

3. Presentation Layer (presentation/)

- Handles UI and state management.
- Uses domain logic to interact with data.

4. Infrastructure Layer (infrastructure/)

- Deals with external concerns like routing, services, and environment configurations.

5. Application Layer (app/)

- Initializes dependencies and configurations.
- Acts as the entry point for the application.

## When to Use Clean Architecture?

- When developing large-scale applications with complex business logic.

- When needing clear separation between business rules and UI.

- When working in teams requiring modular and maintainable code.

## Benefits

✅ Testability - Business logic can be tested in isolation.
✅ Maintainability - Code is structured for easy modifications.
✅ Scalability - Architecture supports growth without major refactoring.
✅ Separation of Concerns - Different responsibilities are clearly defined.

## Conclusion

Clean Architecture helps frontend developers build scalable and maintainable applications by enforcing separation of concerns and dependency inversion. Following this methodology ensures that applications remain adaptable and robust over time.
