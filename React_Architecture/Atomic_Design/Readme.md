# Atomic Design Architecture

## Overview
Atomic Design is a methodology for creating scalable, maintainable UI components. It was introduced by Brad Frost and is inspired by chemistry, where UI components are broken down into five hierarchical levels: `Atoms`, `Molecules`, `Organisms`, `Templates`, and `Pages`.

## Principles
- **Separation of Concerns** - Each UI component is broken down into its smallest meaningful part.
- **Reusability** - Components are designed to be reusable and composable.
- **Scalability** - The methodology allows for easy expansion as applications grow.
- **Consistency** - A structured approach ensures uniform design across the application.

 │   ├── molecules/       # Combinations of atoms (input fields with labels, buttons with icons)
 │   ├── organisms/       # Complex UI sections (headers, cards, navigation bars)
 │
 ├── templates/          # Page-level component structures without actual data
 │
 ├── pages/              # Fully built pages using templates and organisms
