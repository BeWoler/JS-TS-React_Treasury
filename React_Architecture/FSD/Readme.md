# Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Architecture

## Overview
Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for organizing front-end applications, particularly in large-scale projects. The core idea is to structure the project based on business features rather than technical layers, improving scalability, maintainability, and reusability.

## Principles
- **Separation by Features** - Organize the project based on functional features instead of technical layers.
- **Explicit Layers** - Each feature is divided into clear layers: `entities`, `features`, `shared`, `widgets`, `pages`, and `app`.
- **Encapsulation** - Each module should encapsulate its logic to reduce dependencies.
- **Reusability** - Components and logic that can be used across different features should be placed in `shared`.
- **Scalability** - Designed to accommodate project growth with minimal refactoring.

## Layers Explanation

1. App Layer (app/)

- Initializes the application, providers, global settings, routing, and entry point.

2. Shared Layer (shared/)

- Contains reusable utilities, hooks, and UI components.
- No business logic here.

3. Entities Layer (entities/)

- Represents domain models and state management.
- Includes business logic, API interactions, and UI components specific to the entity.

4. Features Layer (features/)

- Implements isolated functionalities.
- A feature consists of its state, UI components, API calls, and utility functions.

5. Widgets Layer (widgets/)

- Combines multiple features into a single UI component.
- Example: Navbar, which includes user authentication status and navigation links.

6. Pages Layer (pages/)

- Assembles features and widgets into full-page layouts.
- Typically linked with the router.

7. Process Layer (process/)

- Stores global processes such as authentication, theme management, and configurations.

## When to Use FSD?

- Large-scale applications where features grow over time.

- Teams that need modularity and separation of concerns.

- Projects requiring easy scalability and maintainability.

## Benefits

✅ Scalability - Easily extend the project structure as features grow.
✅ Maintainability - Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier.
✅ Reusability - Shared components and utilities prevent code duplication.
✅ Better Collaboration - Teams can work on isolated features without conflicts.

## Conclusion

Feature-Sliced Design is a modern and efficient way to structure large React applications, offering better modularity, separation of concerns, and maintainability. By following this methodology, developers can build scalable and well-organized projects with minimal technical debt.
