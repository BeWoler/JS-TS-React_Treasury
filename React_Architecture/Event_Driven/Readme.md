# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) for Frontend Applications

## Overview
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where components communicate by emitting and responding to events. Instead of direct interactions, services react asynchronously to changes in the system, promoting scalability, decoupling, and flexibility.

## Principles
- **Asynchronous Communication** - Components interact through events rather than direct function calls.
- **Loose Coupling** - Services remain independent and only react to relevant events.
- **Scalability** - Event-driven systems can easily scale by adding more consumers or event processors.
- **Flexibility** - Easy to add new features by listening to existing events.
- **Resilience** - System components can fail independently without affecting others.

## Layers Explanation

1. Event Layer (events/)

- Defines and manages system-wide events.
- Includes an event bus for centralized event dispatching.

2. Service Layer (services/)

- Listens to and reacts to events.
- Contains business logic, ensuring a clear separation from UI components.

3. API Layer (api/)

- Handles external communication via HTTP, WebSockets, or GraphQL.
- Some events may trigger API calls or sync with backend systems.

4. Component Layer (components/)

- UI components subscribe to relevant events and update the UI accordingly.

5. Page Layer (pages/)

- Higher-level UI components that integrate multiple event-driven components.

6. State Management Layer (state/)

- Stores global application state, often updated in response to events.
- Works with Redux, Zustand, or other state management libraries.

7. Infrastructure Layer (infrastructure/)

- Handles system-wide concerns like routing, logging, and analytics.

## When to Use EDA?

- When building real-time applications with high responsiveness.

- When working with microservices or distributed frontend components.

- When requiring scalability and loose coupling between services.

- When dealing with frequent state updates (e.g., notifications, live updates).

## Benefits

✅ Scalability - Event-driven systems can easily scale by adding more event consumers.
✅ Flexibility - New functionality can be added by listening to existing events.
✅ Loose Coupling - Services interact through events, reducing direct dependencies.
✅ Resilience - A failure in one component does not necessarily break the whole system.
✅ Improved Performance - Asynchronous processing leads to better system responsiveness.

## Conclusion

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a powerful paradigm for building scalable, flexible, and decoupled frontend applications. By structuring the system around events, developers can create applications that respond efficiently to changes while remaining resilient and maintainable.
