## ðŸ“Œ **Slots Pattern**

### **Definition:**
The **Slots** pattern is a technique often associated with **Vue.js**, but it can be applied in React as well. It allows components to accept dynamic content passed in from parent components. Itâ€™s similar to the idea of having placeholders where content can be injected into certain areas of a componentâ€™s structure.

### **How it works:**
- The parent component provides the content, which is rendered in specific sections (or "slots") of the child component.
- In React, this can typically be achieved by using the special `children` prop or by creating custom props for different sections (like "header", "footer", etc.).

### **Example use case:**
- Creating reusable layouts, such as cards, modals, or tables, where parts of the content (e.g., header, footer, body) can be customized by the parent component.
