# 📌 Proxy Component Pattern in React

## **Definition**
A **Proxy Component** is a higher-order component that **wraps child components** to modify, extend, or intercept their behavior.  

It is particularly useful for **logging, authentication, validation, or dynamic behavior modifications** without changing the child components themselves.  

📌 **Key Idea:** The proxy component receives `children`, wraps them in additional logic, and returns modified JSX.

## **🔹 How It Works?**
1️⃣ **The parent (proxy) component** receives `children`.  
2️⃣ It can **modify their behavior** by passing additional props or event handlers.  
3️⃣ Child components **remain unaware** of the proxy, making it reusable and flexible.  

## **🔹 Example: Auth Proxy**
